Figure1
Original Description: Figure1 shows population growth rates in Brooklyn and Manhattan (Projection after 2010). The data was retrieved from NYC open data, New York City Population by Borough, 1950 - 2040 and converted to growth rates. 
We can see that after 2020 the rate of Manhattan drops drastically while that of Brooklyn keeps about 3%. 

Along with advises, I changed
- y_label. As a referees mentioned, I use raw number instead of percentage because it would generate one more information, i.e. difference of scales between Brooklyn and Manhattan here.


Along with advises, I did not change
- color 
One referee mentioned to use color as black and gray is not interesting. However, another referee valued it and I believe vivid colors are sometimes distracting. Also, gray and black is good for color blindness.
