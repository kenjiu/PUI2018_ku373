### This is a file which reviews plots created by xh1163.

xh1163 created a figure which describes the relationship between Day of week and the number of riders age under and over 40 in February 2014. 

CLARITY: This figure clearly shows the absolute numbers for each age group. However, it is a little bit difficult to figure out the distribution of percentages of riders each day (e.g. Monday:25%), which is quite important imformation as well. In order to compare 2 age groups, you could use percentages of bikers instead of absolute numbers to make histogram.
