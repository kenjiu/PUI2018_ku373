Detecting outlier rent in NYC 

This folder contains two notebooks. One is for scraping and another is for data cleaning and perform calculation. The detailed instruction is written in notebooks and analyses are noted in the link below.

Abstract: 
In this paper, we will try to find out outlier neighborhoods in terms of rent price, safety, and commuting time to city centers. We assume that market price in terms of rent is not all the time perfect and there could be some neighborhoods which are undervalued. Exploring NYC rent data, NYC crime data, and google map, we apply Local Outlier Factor approach, which was introduced by Breunig, Kriegel, Ng, & Sander (2000). 
As a result, we found seven outliers, which might be undervalued or overvalued and concluded that Little Italy, Battery Park, and Murray Hill (Manhattan) are good deals to live. On the other hand, East New York, Bedford Stuyvesant, and Tribeca might be overvalued. 
we should note a limitation. Since we set two specific destinations to calculate commuting time from each neighborhood, these conclusions, i.e. overvalued or undervalued, are not applied people who have to commute different destinations.
